NREL Validation Todo List...
1. Timeseries plots of buoy/model winds (at selected stations).  Probably need to create subplots for each month or quarter.
2. Timeseries plots of buoy/model daily mean/std winds
3. Scatterplot of buoy/model winds (hourly and daily)

4. Calculate full year validation statistics for each station
5. Calculate validation statistics for each month and plot them for each station

6. Timeseries plots of daily buoy/model mean_difference / RMS wind speeds 
7. Scatterplot of daily buoy/model mean_diff (or RMS) vs. daily buoy/SST difference (or RMS)
